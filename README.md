## Mentor Point Allocation System
This repository contains the logic and rules for the Mentor Point Allocation System. The purpose of this system is to incentivize mentors for their participation and engagement in a mentorship program. Mentors can earn points based on various actions, which are later used to reward them for their contributions.

### Key Features
- Mentors receive points for signing up, mentoring multiple mentees, and conducting sessions.
- The system ensures that points are fairly distributed based on the quality and consistency of mentorship sessions.
- A cap on points ensures that mentors are rewarded fairly without exceeding maximum allocations per mentee.
